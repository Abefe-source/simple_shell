### "The Gates of Shell‚Äù, by Spencer Cheng, featuring Julien Barbier

### Description

This Shell project is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Additional functions are also included. This program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for ALX AFRICA SE.

### Installation

All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using GCC with the following flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

### Usage

After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.

#### Included Built-Ins

Our shell has the following built-in commands:

| Command             | 
Definition                                                                                |

| env                 | indicates the environment variable.
